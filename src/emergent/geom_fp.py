Geometry & fixed-point helpers (paper-faithful Benincasa–Dowker 4D stencil).

This module provides:
  • Exact 4D Benincasa–Dowker (BD) combinatorial stencil weights (layered interval counts).
  • A local scalar-curvature estimator entry point for 4D in terms of those counts.
  • A minimal, paper-stable geometric fixed-point helper g_fp exposed at edge granularity
    (kept for API compatibility with existing notebooks/tests).
  • A tiny, deterministic quick-check for smoke testing on a toy DAG.

Design notes
------------
• Determinism: all helpers are pure-Python and seeded deterministically when randomness is used.
• HPC hooks (numba/JAX) must wrap these pure-Python references and match outputs bit-for-bit.

Mathematical references
-----------------------
• The 4D BD operator uses a finite stencil of interval "layer" counts with fixed integer weights.
  Those weights appear in the literature and in Paper III; here they are encoded explicitly as
  integers in BD4_WEIGHTS_LAYERS with an explicit normalisation factor for curvature
  reconstruction. (No interpolation/phenomenology.)
• See also Paper I v8 for the invariants we keep green (spectral/adjointness/measure consistency).

#: Integer weights for the 4D BD layered-interval stencil (k = 0..4).
#: These are paper-exact integers; do not alter unless the paper’s constants change.
#: Convention: "counts" below expects a mapping k -> N_k (nonnegative integers).

#: Curvature normalisation factor (dimensionful density factor must be supplied by caller).
#: The estimator used here is:
#:     R_hat(x) = BD4_CURVATURE_NORMALISATION * sum_{k=0}^4 w_k * N_k(x) / rho^{1/2}
#: where rho is the sprinkling density (or the scale factor implied by your site model).
#: IMPORTANT: This value encodes the analytic prefactor as per the 4D BD derivation.

    r"""
    4D Benincasa–Dowker scalar curvature estimator from local interval-layer counts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    counts :
        Mapping k ↦ N_k for k = 0,1,2,3,4 (missing keys are treated as 0).
        Here N_k is the number of elements in the k-th BD layer in the (inclusive) past of x.
    rho :
        Effective density (or site-scale proxy) entering the 4D normalisation; must be > 0.
        In causal-set sprinklings, rho is the Poisson density; in site models, use the scale
        that matches Paper III’s mapping.
    weights :
        Optional override of the integer weights (defaults to the exact BD4 weights).
    normalisation :
        Optional override of the normalisation constant (defaults to BD4_CURVATURE_NORMALISATION).

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The scalar-curvature estimator R_hat(x).

    Notes
    -----
    • This is the paper-faithful, finite stencil (no interpolation or "4D-lite").
    • Deterministic: depends only on `counts`, `rho`, and the fixed weights/prefactor.
